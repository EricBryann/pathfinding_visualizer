https://pathfinding-visualizer-nine.vercel.app/

This is a pathfinding visualizer I built after my data structures course this semester.

I used React for this visualizer.

You can choose a starting, ending point, and add some walls/obstacles. The visualizer will find a path (may not necessarily be shortest) from the start point to the end point without going through the walls/obstacles. 
Currently only BFS and DFS algorithms are supported.
